/*

I only want to look at job postings from the first quarter with a salary over $80k. 

- Note: I created three separate tables from the job_postings_fact table for each month of the first quarter of the year (Jan-Mar) with this query 

        CREATE TABLE (table name with month) AS

        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            job_postings_fact
        WHERE
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = (month of the year);

- Alias is necessary because it will return an error without it. Itâ€™s needed for subqueries in the FROM clause.
- Combine job posting tables from the first quarter of 2023 (Jan-Mar) (Use UNION_ALL)
- Gets job postings with an average yearly salary > $80,000 from the first quarter of 2023 (Jan-Mar)
- Why? Look at job postings for the first quarter of 2023 (Jan-Mar) that have a salary > $80,000
