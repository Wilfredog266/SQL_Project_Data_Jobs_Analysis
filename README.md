# Introduction
Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and  where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

Check my SQL queries here: [sql_project folder](/sql_project/)

# Background
This is a capstone project from Luke Barousse SQL course with a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from his [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I utilized the power of several important tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** A great and relatively easy option for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs and some specific states. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id   
WHERE
    (job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND (job_location = 'Florida' OR job_location = 'New York' OR job_location = 'Anywhere'))
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
    10;
```
Insights from the Data Analyst Job Postings in 2023:

- **Average Salary Across All Listed Roles:**
The average salary for the top 10 data analyst roles is approximately $215,278.43 per year.

- **Distribution of Job Titles:**
The most common job title is "Data Analyst," appearing 3 times.
Several unique roles appear only once, such as "ERM Data Analyst," "Principal Data Intelligence Analyst - Cardiac - Remote," and "Manager, Data Analyst."

- **Companies with the Highest Average Salary Offers:**
Mantys offers the highest average salary at $650,000.00.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN 
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id   
    WHERE
        (job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND (job_location = 'Florida' OR job_location = 'New York' OR job_location = 'Anywhere'))
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT
        10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills 
FROM top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023, based on job postings:

**SQL** is leading with a bold count of **8**.
